Here are some questions to guide you through the process of doing a task analysis. You don't have to specifically answer each one of these (and some may not apply), but they should get you started thinking in the right direction. 

What are the prerequisites, for both knowledge and e.g. software setup? 

Users should understand basic diagnostic testing concepts: sensitivity, specificity, and binary disease outcomes. Basic R skills are required loading data, installing packages, and running functions. Users will need R, RStudio, and the `pROC` and `ggplot2` packages installed.

What are the basic requirements for any data that the method is used on? 

- Are missing values allowed? 
- Should the data be confined within a certain range? 
- Does the data have to be approximately normally distributed? 
  
  The dataset must have a numeric column for the continuous test result and a binary column for disease status (0/1 or a two-level factor). (ROC analysis is not appropriate for binary test results) Missing values are dropped by default in `pROC`, so users should check how many observations are affected. No distribution assumptions are required.


What are the basic components of the task?
  - Outline these in a bit more detail
  
1. Decide if ROC analysis is appropriate.(this includes identifieing if the results are continous or binary and if the use of a ROC curve is relevant)
2. Prepare the data. Confirm column types, check for missing values
3. Generate the ROC curve and AUC. Use `pROC::roc()` with the response and predictor variables, then `pROC::auc()` to get the AUC.
4. Visualize and interpret. Plot using `pROC::ggroc()` and annotate with the AUC.As describied in the article (basic interpretation), a curve bowing toward the upper-left indicates good discrimination; an AUC of 0.5 means no discriminative ability and 1.0 means perfect.


What decisions does the user need to be prepared to make on the fly?

- Is ROC analysis the right tool for this data and research question?
- Is the test direction set correctly in `roc()`? (`direction = "<"` or `direction = ">"`) 
- Is the AUC meaningful in this clinical or scientific context?

What questions should the user ask of the "first draft" of the product? What adjustments may need to be made?

- Does the curve bow toward the upper-left as expected?
- Does the observation count match your dataset?
- Are results consistent with prior literature on this test?

adjustments

-If the AUC is below 0.5, the test direction is likely flipped and might require user to reverse the direction argument.

## Additional Guidance 

Your check-in should answer these basic questions (and similar concerns that apply more directly to your topic). 

Once you've completed the check-in, you can use this section to jump-start an introduction/set-up/getting started section in your user guide. 
This document should remain as an appendix to your main report.
